## what is timtrade?

timtrade is a virtual marketplace connecting MIT students with other students who have the items they wish to buy, trade, or borrow. users are able to browse items, help fulfill instant requests for items, create requests to obtain items, and list their own items to offer away. check out timtrade, where items you once could only imagine you had can become yours today! (note: actual payment, messaging, and more are done on an individual basis; we simply provide a platform for connecting people).
