## what is timtrade?

timtrade is a virtual hub connecting MIT students with items they wish to buy, trade, or sell. Users are able to browse items, help fulfill instant requests for items, create their own requests to obtain items, and list their own items to offer away. Check out timtrade, where items you could only imagine you had can become yours today!
